# OpencvPython

11.08.2021- This repo is a clone (with a little modification) of the course found at https://www.computervision.zone/lessons/video-tutorial-2

I am going to add more as I progress

This repo presents some of the basics of opencv using Python. It is compatible with python 3.7 and latter versions.
